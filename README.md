## Restaurant reviews project

### Q1. My map doesn't show up
I created my mapbox token and input it on both `main.js` & `restaurant_info.js`, but I got a 401 error msg

```
/**
 * Initialize leaflet map, called from HTML.
 */
initMap = () => {
  self.newMap = L.map('map', {
        center: [40.722216, -73.987501],
        zoom: 12,
        scrollWheelZoom: false
      });
  L.tileLayer('https://api.tiles.mapbox.com/v4/{id}/{z}/{x}/{y}.jpg70?access_token={mapboxToken}', {
    mapboxToken: '<pk.eyJ1IjoiYWRldGVjaCIsImEiOiJjamtpdjM5YnkxOWt2M3JreGpkbnl6N3M3In0.6nZz0MSvsz6HKHJfYq-0zg>',
    maxZoom: 18,

      'Imagery Â© <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/">Mapbox</a>',
    id: 'mapbox.streets'
  }).addTo(newMap);

  updateRestaurants();
}

```

How can I fix that?

#### Answer
Simply, you did forget to remove open and close tags at the beginning and the end of your token
```
mapboxToken: 'pk.eyJ1IjoiYWRldGVjaCIsImEiOiJjamtpdjM5YnkxOWt2M3JreGpkbnl6N3M3In0.6nZz0MSvsz6HKHJfYq-0zg',
```

It should be working now

### Q2. Problem with python server

When I run the following command lin on my terminal to start the server
```
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

I get bunch of error lines, it says: **Address already in use**
```
python3 -m http.server 8000
Traceback (most recent call last):

    self.socket.bind(self.server_address)

```
#### Answer

probably you have a server already running on your machine with the same port 8000, perhaps there is a process running in background and using that port, so you need to change your app port ton another number:

On `db_helper.js` file of your project, change the port value

* e.g: ```const port= 8060```
* Try to run the server with updated port
```
python3 -m http.server 8060
```
* Don't forget to update your `README.md` file

### Q3. Responsive design

Can I use Bootstrap to make my app responsive for this project?

#### Answer

No, Bootstrap and other CSS frameworks should not be used, all responsiveness should be done with CSS.

### Q4. Accessibility
How can I be sure that my work on accessibility meets the specification? 

#### Answer

You can use chrome developer tool:
1. The Accessibility pane is where you can view the accessibility tree, ARIA attributes, and computed accessibility properties of DOM nodes.

    * Go to Accessibility pane
    * Click the **Elements** tab
    * In the **DOM Tree**, select the element which you want to inspect.
    * Click the **Accessibility tab**
    * Check this full [documentation](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/accessibility/reference) for more explantation
